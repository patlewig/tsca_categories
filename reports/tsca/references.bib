	abstract = {Despite an abundance of online databases providing access to chemical data, there is increasing demand for high-quality, structure-curated, open data to meet the various needs of the environmental sciences and computational toxicology communities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ({EPA}) web-based {CompTox} Chemistry Dashboard is addressing these needs by integrating diverse types of relevant domain data through a cheminformatics layer, built upon a database of curated substances linked to chemical structures. These data include physicochemical, environmental fate and transport, exposure, usage, in vivo toxicity, and in vitro bioassay data, surfaced through an integration hub with link-outs to additional {EPA} data and public domain online resources. Batch searching allows for direct chemical identifier ({ID}) mapping and downloading of multiple data streams in several different formats. This facilitates fast access to available structure, property, toxicity, and bioassay data for collections of chemicals (hundreds to thousands at a time). Advanced search capabilities are available to support, for example, non-targeted analysis and identification of chemicals using mass spectrometry. The contents of the chemistry database, presently containing {\textasciitilde} 760,000 substances, are available as public domain data for download. The chemistry content underpinning the Dashboard has been aggregated over the past 15 years by both manual and auto-curation techniques within {EPA}'s {DSSTox} project. {DSSTox} chemical content is subject to strict quality controls to enforce consistency among chemical substance-structure identifiers, as well as list curation review to ensure accurate linkages of {DSSTox} substances to chemical lists and associated data. The Dashboard, publicly launched in April 2016, has expanded considerably in content and user traffic over the past year. It is continuously evolving with the growth of {DSSTox} into high-interest or data-rich domains of interest to {EPA}, such as chemicals on the Toxic Substances Control Act listing, while providing the user community with a flexible and dynamic web-based platform for integration, processing, visualization and delivery of data and resources. The Dashboard provides support for a broad array of research and regulatory programs across the worldwide community of toxicologists and environmental scientists.},

	abstract = {The collection of chemical structure information and associated experimental data for quantitative structure-activity/property relationship ({QSAR}/{QSPR}) modeling is facilitated by an increasing number of public databases containing large amounts of useful data. However, the performance of {QSAR} models highly depends on the quality of the data and modeling methodology used. This study aims to develop robust {QSAR}/{QSPR} models for chemical properties of environmental interest that can be used for regulatory purposes. This study primarily uses data from the publicly available {PHYSPROP} database consisting of a set of 13 common physicochemical and environmental fate properties. These datasets have undergone extensive curation using an automated workflow to select only high-quality data, and the chemical structures were standardized prior to calculation of the molecular descriptors. The modeling procedure was developed based on the five Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ({OECD}) principles for {QSAR} models. A weighted k-nearest neighbor approach was adopted using a minimum number of required descriptors calculated using {PaDEL}, an open-source software. The genetic algorithms selected only the most pertinent and mechanistically interpretable descriptors (2-15, with an average of 11 descriptors). The sizes of the modeled datasets varied from 150 chemicals for biodegradability half-life to 14,050 chemicals for {logP}, with an average of 3222 chemicals across all endpoints. The optimal models were built on randomly selected training sets (75\%) and validated using fivefold cross-validation ({CV}) and test sets (25\%). The {CV} Q2 of the models varied from 0.72 to 0.95, with an average of 0.86 and an R2 test value from 0.71 to 0.96, with an average of 0.82. Modeling and performance details are described in {QSAR} model reporting format and were validated by the European Commission's Joint Research Center to be {OECD} compliant. All models are freely available as an open-source, command-line application called {OPEn} structure-activity/property Relationship App ({OPERA}). {OPERA} models were applied to more than 750,000 chemicals to produce freely available predicted data on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's {CompTox} Chemistry Dashboard.},

One common concern is the quality of both the chemical structure information and associated experimental data. Here we describe the development of an automated {KNIME} workflow to curate and correct errors in the structure and identity of chemicals using the publicly available {PHYSPROP} physicochemical properties and environmental fate datasets. The workflow first assembles structure-identity pairs using up to four provided chemical identifiers, including chemical name, {CASRNs}, {SMILES}, and {MolBlock}. Problems detected included errors and mismatches in chemical structure formats, identifiers and various structure validation issues, including hypervalency and stereochemistry descriptions. Subsequently, a machine learning procedure was applied to evaluate the impact of this curation process. The performance of {QSAR} models built on only the highest-quality subset of the original dataset was compared with the larger curated and corrected dataset. The latter showed statistically improved predictive performance. The final workflow was used to curate the full list of {PHYSPROP} datasets, and is being made publicly available for further usage and integration by the scientific community.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13321-016-0174-y},
	shorttitle = {{ClassyFire}},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible.
{RESULTS}: We have developed a comprehensive, flexible, and computable, purely structure-based chemical taxonomy ({ChemOnt}), along with a computer program ({ClassyFire}) that uses only chemical structures and structural features to automatically assign all known chemical compounds to a taxonomy consisting of {\textgreater}4800 different categories. This new chemical taxonomy consists of up to 11 different levels (Kingdom, {SuperClass}, Class, {SubClass}, etc.) with each of the categories defined by unambiguous, computable structural rules. Furthermore each category is named using a consensus-based nomenclature and described (in English) based on the characteristic common structural properties of the compounds it contains. The {ClassyFire} webserver is freely accessible at http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/. Moreover, a Ruby {API} version is available at https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/classyfire\_api, which provides programmatic access to the {ClassyFire} server and database. {ClassyFire} has been used to annotate over 77 million compounds and has already been integrated into other software packages to automatically generate textual descriptions for, and/or infer biological properties of over 100,000 compounds. Additional examples and applications are provided in this paper.
{CONCLUSION}: {ClassyFire}, in combination with {ChemOnt} ({ClassyFire}'s comprehensive chemical taxonomy), now allows chemists and cheminformaticians to perform large-scale, rapid and automated chemical classification. Moreover, a freely accessible {API} allows easy access to more than 77 million "{ClassyFire}" classified compounds. The results can be used to help annotate well studied, as well as lesser-known compounds. In addition, these chemical classifications can be used as input for data integration, and many other cheminformatics-related tasks.},

Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P ({MLogP}) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening ({HTS}) leads tend to have higher {MWT} and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-{HTS} era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed.

	abstract = {With the increasing availability of high-resolution mass spectrometers, suspect screening and non-targeted analysis are becoming popular compound identification tools for environmental researchers. Samples of interest often contain a large (unknown) number of chemicals spanning the detectable mass range of the instrument. In an effort to separate these chemicals prior to injection into the mass spectrometer, a chromatography method is often utilized. There are numerous types of gas and liquid chromatographs that can be coupled to commercially available mass spectrometers. Depending on the type of instrument used for analysis, the researcher is likely to observe a different subset of compounds based on the amenability of those chemicals to the selected experimental techniques and equipment. It would be advantageous if this subset of chemicals could be predicted prior to conducting the experiment, in order to minimize potential false-positive and false-negative identifications. In this work, we utilize experimental datasets to predict the amenability of chemical compounds to detection with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{ESI}-{MS}). The assembled dataset totals 5517 unique chemicals either explicitly detected or not detected with {LC}-{ESI}-{MS}. The resulting detected/not-detected matrix has been modeled using specific molecular descriptors to predict which chemicals are amenable to {LC}-{ESI}-{MS}, and to which form(s) of ionization. Random forest models, including a measure of the applicability domain of the model for both positive and negative modes of the electrospray ionization source, were successfully developed. The outcome of this work will help to inform future suspect screening and non-targeted analyses of chemicals by better defining the potential {LC}-{ESI}-{MS} detectable chemical landscape of interest.},

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's {ToxCast} program aims to address these concerns by screening and prioritizing chemicals for potential human toxicity using in vitro assays and in silico approaches.
{OBJECTIVES}: This project aims to evaluate the use of in vitro assays for understanding the types of molecular and pathway perturbations caused by environmental chemicals and to build initial prioritization models of in vivo toxicity.
{METHODS}: We tested 309 mostly pesticide active chemicals in 467 assays across nine technologies, including high-throughput cell-free assays and cell-based assays, in multiple human primary cells and cell lines plus rat primary hepatocytes. Both individual and composite scores for effects on genes and pathways were analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Chemicals displayed a broad spectrum of activity at the molecular and pathway levels. We saw many expected interactions, including endocrine and xenobiotic metabolism enzyme activity. Chemicals ranged in promiscuity across pathways, from no activity to affecting dozens of pathways. We found a statistically significant inverse association between the number of pathways perturbed by a chemical at low in vitro concentrations and the lowest in vivo dose at which a chemical causes toxicity. We also found associations between a small set of in vitro assays and rodent liver lesion formation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This approach promises to provide meaningful data on the thousands of untested environmental chemicals and to guide targeted testing of environmental contaminants.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ({EPA}) {ToxCast} program is testing a large library of Agency-relevant chemicals using in vitro high-throughput screening ({HTS}) approaches to support the development of improved toxicity prediction models. Launched in 2007, Phase I of the program screened 310 chemicals, mostly pesticides, across hundreds of {ToxCast} assay end points. In Phase {II}, the {ToxCast} library was expanded to 1878 chemicals, culminating in the public release of screening data at the end of 2013. Subsequent expansion in Phase {III} has resulted in more than 3800 chemicals actively undergoing {ToxCast} screening, 96\% of which are also being screened in the multi-Agency Tox21 project. The chemical library unpinning these efforts plays a central role in defining the scope and potential application of {ToxCast} {HTS} results. The history of the phased construction of {EPA}'s {ToxCast} library is reviewed, followed by a survey of the library contents from several different vantage points. {CAS} Registry Numbers are used to assess {ToxCast} library coverage of important toxicity, regulatory, and exposure inventories. Structure-based representations of {ToxCast} chemicals are then used to compute physicochemical properties, substructural features, and structural alerts for toxicity and biotransformation. Cheminformatics approaches using these varied representations are applied to defining the boundaries of {HTS} testability, evaluating chemical diversity, and comparing the {ToxCast} library to potential target application inventories, such as used in {EPA}'s Endocrine Disruption Screening Program ({EDSP}). Through several examples, the {ToxCast} chemical library is demonstrated to provide comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains and target inventories of potential interest to {EPA}. Furthermore, the varied representations and approaches presented here define local chemistry domains potentially worthy of further investigation (e.g., not currently covered in the testing library or defined by toxicity "alerts") to strategically support data mining and predictive toxicology modeling moving forward.},

It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, {NumPy} was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. {NumPy} is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, {NumPy} increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface ({API}), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {The present study adapted an existing high content imaging-based high-throughput phenotypic profiling ({HTPP}) assay known as "Cell Painting" for bioactivity screening of environmental chemicals. This assay uses a combination of fluorescent probes to label a variety of organelles and measures a large number of phenotypic features at the single cell level in order to detect chemical-induced changes in cell morphology. First, a small set of candidate phenotypic reference chemicals (n = 14) known to produce changes in the cellular morphology of U-2 {OS} cells were identified and screened at multiple time points in concentration-response format. Many of these chemicals produced distinct cellular phenotypes that were qualitatively similar to those previously described in the literature. A novel workflow for phenotypic feature extraction, concentration-response modeling and determination of in vitro thresholds for chemical bioactivity was developed. Subsequently, a set of 462 chemicals from the {ToxCast} library were screened in concentration-response mode. Bioactivity thresholds were calculated and converted to administered equivalent doses ({AEDs}) using reverse dosimetry. {AEDs} were then compared to effect values from mammalian toxicity studies. In many instances (68\%), the {HTPP}-derived {AEDs} were either more conservative than or comparable to the in vivo effect values. Overall, we conclude that the {HTPP} assay can be used as an efficient, cost-effective and reproducible screening method for characterizing the biological activity and potency of environmental chemicals for potential use in in vitro-based safety assessments.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ({EPA}) is faced with the challenge of efficiently and credibly evaluating chemical safety often with limited or no available toxicity data. The expanding number of chemicals found in commerce and the environment, coupled with time and resource requirements for traditional toxicity testing and exposure characterization, continue to underscore the need for new approaches. In 2005, {EPA} charted a new course to address this challenge by embracing computational toxicology ({CompTox}) and investing in the technologies and capabilities to push the field forward. The return on this investment has been demonstrated through results and applications across a range of human and environmental health problems, as well as initial application to regulatory decision-making within programs such as the {EPA}'s Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. The {CompTox} initiative at {EPA} is more than a decade old. This manuscript presents a blueprint to guide the strategic and operational direction over the next 5 years. The primary goal is to obtain broader acceptance of the {CompTox} approaches for application to higher tier regulatory decisions, such as chemical assessments. To achieve this goal, the blueprint expands and refines the use of high-throughput and computational modeling approaches to transform the components in chemical risk assessment, while systematically addressing key challenges that have hindered progress. In addition, the blueprint outlines additional investments in cross-cutting efforts to characterize uncertainty and variability, develop software and information technology tools, provide outreach and training, and establish scientific confidence for application to different public health and environmental regulatory decisions.},

	abstract = {Recently, numerous organizations, including governmental regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad, have proposed using data from New Approach Methodologies ({NAMs}) for augmenting and increasing the pace of chemical assessments. {NAMs} are broadly defined as any technology, methodology, approach or combination thereof that can be used to provide information on chemical hazard and risk assessment that avoids the use of intact animals. High-throughput transcriptomics ({HTTr}) is a type of {NAM} that uses gene expression profiling as an endpoint for rapidly evaluating the effects of large numbers of chemicals on in vitro cell culture systems. As compared to targeted high-throughput screening ({HTS}) approaches that measure the effect of chemical X on target Y, {HTTr} is a non-targeted approach that allows researchers to more broadly characterize the integrated response of an intact biological system to chemicals that may affect a specific biological target or many biological targets under a defined set of treatment conditions (time, concentration, etc.). {HTTr} screening performed in concentration-response mode can provide potency estimates for the concentrations of chemicals that produce perturbations in cellular response pathways. Here, we discuss study design considerations for {HTTr} concentration-response screening and present a framework for the use of {HTTr}-based biological pathway-altering concentrations ({BPACs}) in a screening-level, risk-based chemical prioritization approach. The framework involves concentration-response modeling of {HTTr} data, mapping gene level responses to biological pathways, determination of {BPACs}, in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation ({IVIVE}) and comparison to human exposure predictions.},

As ToxCast efforts expand (ie, Phase II) beyond food-use pesticides toward a wider chemical domain that lacks exposure and toxicity information, prediction tools become increasingly important. In this study, in vitro hepatic clearance and plasma protein binding were measured to estimate OEDs for a subset of Phase II chemicals. OEDs were compared against high-throughput (HT) exposure predictions generated using probabilistic modeling and Bayesian approaches generated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ExpoCast program. This approach incorporated chemical-specific use and national production volume data with biomonitoring data to inform the exposure predictions. This HT exposure modeling approach provided predictions for all Phase II chemicals assessed in this study whereas estimates from regulatory sources were available for only 7\\% of chemicals. Of the 163 chemicals assessed in this study, 3 or 13 chemicals possessed AERs \\&lt; 1 or \\&lt; 100, respectively.

Performance is typically assessed using reference chemicals – compounds with defined activity against the test system target. However, developing reference chemical lists has historically been very resource-intensive. We developed a semi-automated process for selecting and annotating reference chemicals across many targets in a standardized format and demonstrate the workflow here. A series of required fields defines the potential reference chemical: the in vitro molecular target, pathway, or phenotype affected; and the chemical’s mode (e.g. agonist, antagonist, inhibitor). Activity information was computationally extracted into a database from multiple public sources including non-curated scientific literature and curated chemical-biological databases, resulting in the identification of chemical activity in 2995 biological targets. Sample data from literature sources covering 54 molecular targets ranging from data-poor to data-rich was manually checked for accuracy. Precision rates were 82.7\% from curated data sources and 39.5\% from automated literature extraction. We applied the final reference chemical lists to evaluating performance of {EPA}’s {ToxCast} program in vitro bioassays. The level of support, i.e., the number of independent reports in the database linking a chemical to a target, was found to strongly correlate with likelihood of positive results in the {ToxCast} assays, although individual assay performance had considerable variation. This overall approach allows rapid development of candidate reference chemical lists for a wide variety of targets that can facilitate performance evaluation of in vitro assays as a critical step in imparting confidence in alternative approaches.},

	abstract = {Background:

Humans are exposed to thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment. Some chemicals mimic natural endocrine hormones and, thus, have the potential to be endocrine disruptors. Most of these chemicals have never been tested for their ability to interact with the estrogen receptor ({ER}). Risk assessors need tools to prioritize chemicals for evaluation in costly in vivo tests, for instance, within the U.S. {EPA} Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.

Objectives:

We describe a large-scale modeling project called {CERAPP} (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) and demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for {ER}-related activity and prioritize them for further testing.

Methods:

{CERAPP} combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict {ER} activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure–activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. {EPA}, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist {ER} activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies.

Results:

Individual model scores ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, showing high prediction reliabilities. Out of the 32,464 chemicals, the consensus model predicted 4,001 chemicals (12.3\%) as high priority actives and 6,742 potential actives (20.8\%) to be considered for further testing.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrated the possibility to screen large libraries of chemicals using a consensus of different in silico approaches. This concept will be applied in future projects related to other end points.

	abstract = {Background:

Humans are exposed to tens of thousands of chemical substances that need to be assessed for their potential toxicity. Acute systemic toxicity testing serves as the basis for regulatory hazard classification, labeling, and risk management. However, it is cost- and time-prohibitive to evaluate all new and existing chemicals using traditional rodent acute toxicity tests. In silico models built using existing data facilitate rapid acute toxicity predictions without using animals.

Objectives:

The U.S. Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods ({ICCVAM}) Acute Toxicity Workgroup organized an international collaboration to develop in silico models for predicting acute oral toxicity based on five different end points: Lethal Dose 50 (
lethal dose, 50 percent])
{LD}
50
{LD}50
 value, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency hazard (four) categories, Globally Harmonized System for Classification and Labeling hazard (five) categories, very toxic chemicals [
lethal dose, 50 percent
{LD}
50
{LD}50
 (
lethal dose, 50 percent less than or equal 50 milligrams per kilogram
{LD}
50
≤50mg/kg
{LD}50≤50mg/kg
)], and nontoxic chemicals (
lethal dose, 50 percent greater than 2000 milligrams per kilogram
L
D
50
{\textgreater}2,000mg/kg
{LD}50{\textgreater}2,000mg/kg
).

Methods:

An acute oral toxicity data inventory for 11,992 chemicals was compiled, split into training and evaluation sets, and made available to 35 participating international research groups that submitted a total of 139 predictive models. Predictions that fell within the applicability domains of the submitted models were evaluated using external validation sets. These were then combined into consensus models to leverage strengths of individual approaches.

Results:

The resulting consensus predictions, which leverage the collective strengths of each individual model, form the Collaborative Acute Toxicity Modeling Suite ({CATMoS}). {CATMoS} demonstrated high performance in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared with in vivo results.

Discussion:

{CATMoS} is being evaluated by regulatory agencies for its utility and applicability as a potential replacement for in vivo rat acute oral toxicity studies. {CATMoS} predictions for more than 800,000 chemicals have been made available via the National Toxicology Program’s Integrated Chemical Environment tools and data sets ( ice.ntp.niehs.nih.gov). The models are also implemented in a free, standalone, open-source tool, {OPERA}, which allows predictions of new and untested chemicals to be made. https://doi.org/10.1289/{EHP}8495},

	abstract = {Background:

Endocrine disrupting chemicals ({EDCs}) are xenobiotics that mimic the interaction of natural hormones and alter synthesis, transport, or metabolic pathways. The prospect of {EDCs} causing adverse health effects in humans and wildlife has led to the development of scientific and regulatory approaches for evaluating bioactivity. This need is being addressed using high-throughput screening ({HTS}) in vitro approaches and computational modeling.

Objectives:

In support of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ({EPA}) led two worldwide consortiums to virtually screen chemicals for their potential estrogenic and androgenic activities. Here, we describe the Collaborative Modeling Project for Androgen Receptor Activity ({CoMPARA}) efforts, which follows the steps of the Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project ({CERAPP}).

Methods:

The {CoMPARA} list of screened chemicals built on {CERAPP}’s list of 32,464 chemicals to include additional chemicals of interest, as well as simulated {ToxCast}™ metabolites, totaling 55,450 chemical structures. Computational toxicology scientists from 25 international groups contributed 91 predictive models for binding, agonist, and antagonist activity predictions. Models were underpinned by a common training set of 1,746 chemicals compiled from a combined data set of 11 {ToxCast}™/Tox21 {HTS} in vitro assays.

Results:

The resulting models were evaluated using curated literature data extracted from different sources. To overcome the limitations of single-model approaches, {CoMPARA} predictions were combined into consensus models that provided averaged predictive accuracy of approximately 80\% for the evaluation set.

Discussion:

The strengths and limitations of the consensus predictions were discussed with example chemicals; then, the models were implemented into the free and open-source {OPERA} application to enable screening of new chemicals with a defined applicability domain and accuracy assessment. This implementation was used to screen the entire {EPA} {DSSTox} database of 
approximately 875000
∼875,000
∼875,000
 chemicals, and their predicted {AR} activities have been made available on the {EPA} {CompTox} Chemicals dashboard and National Toxicology Program’s Integrated Chemical Environment. https://doi.org/10.1289/{EHP}5580},
